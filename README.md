**Description:**

This Java project implements a fully functional TicTacToe game. The toString() method creates a textual representation of the game board, including lines and current player moves. The print() method displays the game state, showing Xs, Os, and empty spaces. The game detects wins, ties, or ongoing play. Additionally, the TicTacToeFrame class introduces a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using JTextArea and JScrollPane, which updates the game state in real-time, while still accepting input from the terminal. The game flow includes checking for a winner and displaying the results of each game.
